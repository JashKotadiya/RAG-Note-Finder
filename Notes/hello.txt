CALC III NOTES (MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS)1. VECTORS AND GEOMETRY IN SPACEVECTORS (v = <v1, v2, v3>):Magnitude (Length): The square root of the sum of the squares of the components.Unit Vector (u): The vector divided by its magnitude.DOT PRODUCT (SCALAR PRODUCT):Formula: Sum of the products of corresponding components.Geometric: Equals the product of the magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them.ORTHOGONALITY: If the Dot Product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular.CROSS PRODUCT (VECTOR PRODUCT) (Only in 3D):Result: A new vector perpendicular to both original vectors.Magnitude: Gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors.PARALLELISM: If the Cross Product is the zero vector, the vectors are parallel.LINES AND PLANES:Line Equation: Defined by a point and a direction vector. Position is the point vector plus t times the direction vector.Plane Equation: Defined by a point and a normal vector (perpendicular vector). The equation is based on the normal vector's components and the point's coordinates.2. VECTOR FUNCTIONS (CURVES IN SPACE)POSITION: A vector function $\mathrm{r}(t)$ with components $x(t), y(t), z(t)$.VELOCITY: The first derivative of the position vector, $\mathrm{r'}(t)$. It is the tangent vector.SPEED: The magnitude (length) of the velocity vector.ACCELERATION: The second derivative of the position vector, $\mathrm{r''}(t)$.ARC LENGTH (L): The integral of speed over a time interval.CURVATURE ($\kappa$): Measures how sharply a curve bends. Calculated using the magnitudes of the first and second derivatives of the position vector.3. PARTIAL DERIVATIVESPARTIAL DERIVATIVE: Differentiation with respect to one variable, treating all others as constants.$f_x$: Treat $y$ as a constant and differentiate $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$.$f_y$: Treat $x$ as a constant and differentiate $f(x, y)$ with respect to $y$.CHAIN RULE: Used to find the derivative of a function when its variables are themselves functions of other variables.GRADIENT VECTOR: A vector $\nabla f$ containing all the partial derivatives. It points in the direction of maximum increase of the function.DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE: The rate of change of $f$ in the direction of a unit vector $\mathrm{u}$. Calculated by taking the Dot Product of the gradient and the unit vector.TANGENT PLANES: The gradient vector at a point on a level surface is the normal vector to the tangent plane at that point.OPTIMIZATION (MAX/MIN):Critical Points: Found where the gradient vector is the zero vector (all partial derivatives are zero).Second Derivative Test: Uses a discriminant (D) involving the second partial derivatives ($f_{xx}, f_{yy}, f_{xy}$) to classify critical points.If $D$ is positive and $f_{xx}$ is positive: Local MINIMUM.If $D$ is positive and $f_{xx}$ is negative: Local MAXIMUM.If $D$ is negative: Saddle Point.4. MULTIPLE INTEGRALS (VOLUME AND MASS)DOUBLE INTEGRALS: Integrals over a 2D region, used to find volume under a surface or area.Fubini's Theorem: Allows reversing the order of integration.POLAR COORDINATES (For circular regions):Transformation: $x = r \cos \theta$, $y = r \sin \theta$.Differential Area: $dA$ is replaced by $r \, dr \, d\theta$.TRIPLE INTEGRALS: Integrals over a 3D region (solid), used to find volume or mass.CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES (For $z$-axis symmetry):Transformation: Uses $r, \theta, z$.Differential Volume: $dV$ is replaced by $r \, dz \, dr \, d\theta$.SPHERICAL COORDINATES (For origin symmetry, cones/balls):Transformation: Uses $\rho$ (distance from origin), $\phi$ (angle from positive $z$-axis), $\theta$ (angle in $xy$-plane).Differential Volume: $dV$ is replaced by $\rho^2 \sin \phi \, d\rho \, d\phi \, d\theta$.5. VECTOR CALCULUS (THE BIG THEOREMS)LINE INTEGRAL (WORK): Integrates a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ along a curve $C$. Represents the work done by the force field.CONSERVATIVE FIELDS: If the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ is the gradient of a scalar function, the line integral is path-independent and only depends on the start and end points.GREEN'S THEOREM (2D): Relates a Line Integral around a closed curve to a Double Integral over the region enclosed.STOKES' THEOREM (3D): Relates the Line Integral around the boundary of a surface to a Surface Integral of the curl of the vector field.The curl is the Cross Product of the gradient operator and the vector field.DIVERGENCE THEOREM (GAUSS'S THEOREM): Relates the Surface Integral of a vector field over a closed surface to a Triple Integral of the divergence over the enclosed solid.The divergence is the Dot Product of the gradient operator and the vector field (the sum of the partial derivatives of the components).
